// Alternative 1: Use relative paths instead of aliases
// This works because the consuming app processes this file
// The path is relative to where the consuming app's vite.config.ts is located
// For participant/admin projects, this resolves to ../../page-builder/blocks/**/*.vue
export const blockModules = import.meta.glob("../../page-builder/blocks/**/*.vue", { eager: true });

// However, this is fragile because it depends on the file location relative to the consuming app
// Better: Use a build-time script (see Alternative 2)
