## What is vue-wswg-editor?

`vue-wswg-editor` enables developers to create visual editors where users can:

- **Drag and drop blocks** to build pages visually
- **Edit block properties** through a comprehensive sidebar editor
- **Preview pages** in real-time with responsive viewport controls
- **Manage page layouts** with customizable layout components
- **Define custom blocks** with field configurations and validation

The library uses a JSON-based data structure, making it easy to store, version, and transfer page configurations.

## Key Concepts

Before diving in, it's helpful to understand a few key concepts:

- **Blocks**: Reusable components that make up a page (e.g., Hero, Divider, Feature Grid)
- **Layouts**: Page templates that wrap blocks (e.g., Default, Marketing)
- **Fields**: Editable properties of blocks (e.g., heading, description, color)
- **Registry**: The system that discovers and manages blocks, layouts, and fields
