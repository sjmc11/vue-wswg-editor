# Examples

This page provides examples and reference implementations for using vue-wswg-editor.

## Starter Kit

The [page-builder-starter-kit](https://github.com/sjmc11/page-builder-starter-kit) repository contains a complete reference implementation for building pages with the vue-wswg-editor library. This starter kit is extracted from the `page-builder` directory used in the [vue-wswg-demos](https://github.com/sjmc11/vue-wswg-demos) project, which demonstrates a full vue-wswg-editor library implementation.

### What's Included

The starter kit provides:

- **9 Example Blocks** - Pre-built blocks including:
   - Hero sections (with and without images)
   - Feature Grid with icon support
   - FAQ Section with expandable items
   - Article Feed
   - Announcement banners
   - Divider components
   - Image Text blocks
   - Poll sections

- **Custom Fields** - Rich text editor field component using TipTap with a full formatting toolbar

- **Layout Components** - Default and landing page layouts with reusable header/footer partials

- **Complete Structure** - Properly organized directory structure following best practices

### Getting Started

You can use the starter kit as:

- **A foundation** - Copy it into your project and customize it for your needs
- **A reference** - Study the examples to learn how to build custom blocks and fields
- **A learning tool** - See real-world implementations of common page builder patterns

The starter kit includes all necessary dependencies and installation instructions. See the [README](https://github.com/sjmc11/page-builder-starter-kit) for details.
